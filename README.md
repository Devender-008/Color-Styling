# Colorful Headings and Paragraphs with CSS Enhancements

This project demonstrates how to use HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing layout with colorful headings and paragraphs. It separates CSS from HTML to maintain clean and manageable code, and it includes enhanced styling to create a more attractive and interactive web page.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing style applied to the HTML elements.

## Features

- **Modern Styling**: Enhanced styles using CSS for better visual appeal, including padding, margin, background colors, border-radius, box-shadow, and hover effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses flexbox for centering content, ensuring the layout is responsive and centered in the viewport.




## Customization

- **Changing Colors**: You can easily change the colors of the headings and paragraphs by modifying the `styles.css` file.
- **Adding More Elements**: Add more HTML elements in the `index.html` file and style them in `style.css` as needed.
- **Experiment with Styles**: Play around with different CSS properties like font-family, font-size, padding, margin, etc., to see how they affect the layout and design.
